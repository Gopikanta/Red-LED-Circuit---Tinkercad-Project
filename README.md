# Red-LED-Circuit---Tinkercad-Project
This is a simple LED circuit project created in Tinkercad as part of my journey learning electronics and circuit design.

**Circuit Description**

This project demonstrates a basic LED circuit with the following components:

*Components Used*

* 1x Red LED (Light Emitting Diode)

* 1x Resistor (current-limiting)

* 1x 9V Battery

* Connecting wires

**Circuit Functionality**

* The circuit implements a basic LED lighting system where:

* The 9V battery provides power to the circuit

* A resistor limits the current flowing through the LED to prevent damage

* The LED illuminates when the circuit is complete

**Purpose**

This project serves as a foundational exercise in understanding:

* Basic circuit design principles
  
* Current limiting with resistors
  
* Proper LED connections (anode/cathode polarity)
  
* Using Tinkercad for circuit simulation

**Simulation**

The circuit was designed and tested using Tinkercad's Circuit Simulator, which allows for:

* Virtual breadboarding
  
* Real-time circuit simulation
  
* Component testing before physical implementation

**Future Improvements**

* Add a switch for manual control
  
* Implement multiple LEDs in series/parallel
  
* Create blinking patterns using a 555 timer IC

* Add a potentiometer for brightness control

**Tools Used**
